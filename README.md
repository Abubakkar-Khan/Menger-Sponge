# Menger Sponge - 3D Fractal Visualization

Welcome to the **Menger Sponge** project! This website provides an interactive 3D visualization of the Menger Sponge, a fascinating fractal that demonstrates the beauty of mathematics and self-similarity.

## About the Menger Sponge

The **Menger Sponge** is a 3D fractal that starts with a cube divided into 27 smaller cubes. In each iteration, certain cubes are removed, creating an increasingly intricate and porous structure. Despite the growing complexity, its volume approaches zero while the surface area becomes infinite, making it a paradoxical and captivating mathematical object.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive 3D View**: Explore the Menger Spongeâ€™s recursive structure.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Watch each iteration unfold.
- **Educational Tool**: Understand fractals, self-similarity, and infinite surfaces.
